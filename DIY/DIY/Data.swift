//Le strutture sono tipi di dati complessi, cioè composti da più valori. Si crea quindi un'istanza della struct e si inseriscono i suoi valori, per poi passarla come un singolo valore nel codice.

//Quando si definisce una struct, Swift ne facilita la creazione perché genera automaticamente quello che viene chiamato memberwise initializer. In parole povere, significa che si crea la struct passando i valori iniziali per le sue due proprietà, come in questo caso:

Then, lay the second strip on top of the first with the right sides facing each other. Pin and sew along the edge with a 1/2-inch seam allowance.
